# Tomorrow Theme
After having spent over five years tweaking and refining an editor theme I've finally decided to release "Tomorrow Theme" - a colourful theme with pastel colours and sensible syntax highlighting.

## Language Support
The theme has been designed to be language independent and should look great with any language. However, if it doesn't, just send me some sample code and I'll fix it!

## The Future?
I'll be releasing other variations of this theme and adding support for other editors (any suggestions?). I'm currently working on perfecting the Vim theme.
